Anthony Damiano <adamiano001>, 6/3/2024 1:36:00 PM:  Hello Sarah -
Your MDICI request has been received and assigned the following project number: ID 2243 Higuera Health Center Sonosite M-Turbo & S-Series
There is some information missing from this form that I need to verify before I assign resources and a start date.
I'm not sure who or what ""Advanced Biomed"" is - we need the name of someone from the Clinical Engineering staff for this field:
Name of Clinical Engineering Manager for this Location               Advanced Biomed
There should be a PACS admin that helps with this location:
Name of PACS Admin for this Location       none
Is this PACS connectivity correct that you only need one connection to destination IP: 10.209.200.76 over port 12017?
What is your PACS/CPACS vendor?          Merative
What is the PACS Modality Worklist AE Title, IP address, and port this device will query for MWL?TBD
What is the PACS AE Title, IP address, and port which will receive images from this device?         CCSA_GECB_RPACS / IP 10.209.200.76 / Port 12017
Both the M-Turbo and S-Series will only be connected to the wireless network at this location, is that correct? They will not need wireless IPs assigned?
Primary connection method:       Wireless
Device MAC address(es):          S-Cath - 00:08:FB:12:11:CD
M-Turbo - 00:08:FB:11:B9:C6
Once I have all of this information I will assign resources and a start date.
From the start date of the project it can take up to four weeks before the device is ready to test. Once this project is ready to test I will send out networking information with the technical design in a separate email.
Let me know if you have any questions.

Anthony Damiano <adamiano001>, 6/3/2024 1:50:33 PM:  Hello Amber -
Your MDICI request has been received and assigned the following project number: ID 2244 Pacific Central Coast Health Center Sonosite M-Turbo
There were a few things in the submission that I need clarification on.
I'm not sure who Advanced Biomed is, we need the name of a member of the Clinical Engineering staff who supports this area:
Name of Clinical Engineering Manager for this Location               AdvanceBio Med Phone: 1-805-462-3012
For how the device will connect, is it wired or wireless? The intake confused me a bit:
Primary connection method:       Wireless
Provide wireless account name:  No Wireless
Device MAC address(es):          MAC: 00:08:FB:11:A4:05
What port /switch name will device be connecting to:    Wireless
Jeanne - would you be able to provide the PACS information?
What is your PACS/CPACS vendor?          TBD
What is the PACS Modality Worklist AE Title, IP address, and port this device will query for MWL?TBD
What is the PACS AE Title, IP address, and port which will receive images from this device?         TBD
I also changed the IT site director from Dash to Cyndi Lang:
IT Site Director          Cyndi Lang
Once I have all of this information I will assign resources and a start date. From the start date of the project it can take up to four weeks before the device is ready to test. Once this project is ready to test I will send out networking information with the technical design in a separate email.

Keeping this on hold for now until we have more information.

adamiano001 04-14-25 10:29:43: Asked Mitchell Martin which wired and wireless networks to use for imaging devices at this location.

adamiano001 03-10-25 07:58:23: Since it was using a 10.212.x.x IP address I would assume we should use wired VLAN 713 (10.212.213.128/25) & wireless 904 (10.212.84.0/22) from MRMC for this unit? Can someone confirm?

adamiano001 02-24-25 08:03:39: Good Morning - Can anyone tell me which VLAN to use for this device at Stratford Health Center, 1510 E. Main St. Santa Maria, CA 93454?

adamiano001 02-06-25 15:42:24: Good Afternoon - I'm still looking for direction on what VLAN we should be assigning IP addresses on before getting the Design Engineering team involved to help move this forward.

adamiano001 02-04-25 09:00:17: My response to the email thread: So to recap we should be able to move forward assigning wired VLAN 713 IP addresses for this location on 10.212.213.128/25?
Response from Alex Yuan:
Correct, clinic 1510 E Main St., Suite 104-C, Santa Maria, CA 93454 is on a MOE and headends to both hospitals below.
MRMC - 1400 E Church St., Santa Maria, CA 93454 - primary

Without a firewall at the clinic, which is the approved design for the 2 scenarios below?

adamiano001 01-27-25 15:57:24: Good Afternoon - I think Marcello is still waiting on an answer to this question: Can anyone tell me if this site/clinic has connectivity into a hospital via MOE or local circuit? Once we answer that I think we can figure out the best path forward.

adamiano001 01-16-25 12:49:52: Cassandra responded with the correct address: 1510 E Main St, Santa Maria, CA 93454.
Alex verified there is no firewall at this clinic so I'm adding +Marcello Caputi -AZ to this to see which network we should use for the wired IP assignment.

""Also wish to add the following:
There are a couple of tickets for helping on this connectivity opening recently outside of a project/enhancement: SCTASK8416610 for ClinApps-Oncology team and assigned to me, Aaron Allen. But for this location Varian (Aria) is on a vendor hosted cloud and our team doesn't have any Varian servers. Karla was going to call the vendor directly if needed, since we don't maintain the equipment info or have access. (I can also open a ticket with the vendor as well, if the need arises.)
Most relevantly opened today, INC9498687, is for the Firewall team (Firewall-VPN-Load Balancing, assigned to Prashant Samania) since the connectivity issue is likely firewall related.
I think Clinical Engineering does not use the Service Mgt or project lifecycle so not sure if they follow the project/enhancement lifecycle.Perhaps a planning meeting for the install project with all the right teams might be helpful.""

There is currently a static route on the router for the IP range that will need to be removed, before the Vlan and IP are configured.  There used to be a firewall at this location and apparently it was removed, so the configurations for it should also be removed.

Per Rick Dunbar:
This is a ""mission critical"" request and I'd ask that it be granted an exception and be moved to priority status for creation of firewall rules.  Not having network access granted to this device by 7/21 will block critical clinical training on this device during the scheduled applications period.  This device will be the only MRI scanner in service to St. Elizabeth Community Hospital starting 7/25 and if network access is not available to it by then this hospital facility will not be able to offer MRI imaging services.  This will inhibit the ability of our facility to offer appropriate care to our ED inpatients and will require cancellation of our outpatient schedules.  This will have potential financial regulatory and financial ramifications to the facility and organization.

adamiano001 06-20-25 13:01:41: Team - it looks like we may have had an IP address assigned on REQ5865308 (10.241.213.162) that was already assigned on ""ID 969 MGMC CRMC Siemens Definition Edge"". Unfortunately ID 969 is an old effort and I don't have the modality onboarding request for that to see who assigned it and when, but it's document on ID 969, shown below:
I was looking at traffic on the firewall for CRMC as they're installing their GE Allia and AW Workstation and noticed that IP 10.241.213.162 was trying to reach out on the Siemens B2B tunnel so it looks like both the Siemens unit and GE AW Workstation are trying to use that IP address.
Tate - can we get a new IP for the GE AW workstation? It looks like 10.241.213.161 wasn't assigned to anything else.
John - once we get a new IP I'll get you the SCTASK # to update the firewall rules.

adamiano001 05-25-25 16:41:25 - Bulk Comment Update: Good Morning -
I see a note from Jennifer on a couple of IP requests I made for the Clinics around Las Vegas. I was under the impression that each clinic had it own separate VLAN 904 IP scheme but for these two requests:
REQ5805231 - West Flamingo - 9880 West Flamingo Road
REQ5805219 - NLV - 1550 West Craig Road, suite 220
I see this note: Verified with Jason Jenkins on what network clinics are using and it should be this 10.237.84.0/22
So my follow up question is, will all of the clinics around Las Vegas use 10.237.84.0/22?
This is how I thought they were configured:
4855 Blue Diamond Rd, Las Vegas, NV 89139 - 10.33.19.128/26
10001 S. Eastern Avenue, suite 101  Henderson, NV 89052 - 10.238.140.0/22
Henderson - Pavilion Primary Care - 800 N Gibson Road - to be determined

I see a note from Jennifer on a couple of IP requests I made for the Clinics around Las Vegas. I was under the impression that each clinic had it own separate VLAN 904 IP scheme but for these two requests:
REQ5805231 - West Flamingo - 9880 West Flamingo Road
REQ5805219 - NLV - 1550 West Craig Road, suite 220
I see this note: Verified with Jason Jenkins on what network clinics are using and it should be this 10.237.84.0/22
So my follow up question is, will all of the clinics around Las Vegas use 10.237.84.0/22?
This is how I thought they were configured:
4855 Blue Diamond Rd, Las Vegas, NV 89139 - 10.33.19.128/26

Hi Anthony,
Thank you so much for following up on this.
I apologize you have not been included in all communication.
I did send an email to Josh and Dusty last Friday including Andrea Somenfield, and Debi McLelland.
I know that they were having some issues with connectivity preventing to start testing.

If this needs to be connected to the network for remote support I will need a MAC address for IP assignment and the details around the remote support connection.

adamiano001 05-25-25 16:41:25 - Bulk Comment Update: Good Morning -
I see a note from Jennifer on a couple of IP requests I made for the Clinics around Las Vegas. I was under the impression that each clinic had it own separate VLAN 904 IP scheme but for these two requests:
REQ5805231 - West Flamingo - 9880 West Flamingo Road
REQ5805219 - NLV - 1550 West Craig Road, suite 220
I see this note: Verified with Jason Jenkins on what network clinics are using and it should be this 10.237.84.0/22
So my follow up question is, will all of the clinics around Las Vegas use 10.237.84.0/22?
This is how I thought they were configured:
4855 Blue Diamond Rd, Las Vegas, NV 89139 - 10.33.19.128/26
10001 S. Eastern Avenue, suite 101  Henderson, NV 89052 - 10.238.140.0/22
Henderson - Pavilion Primary Care - 800 N Gibson Road - to be determined

There were no destinations listed on the intake but from previous installs I believe the wired base stations connect as shown below. Please verify if this connectivity diagram looks correct and that the Inform II base stations will connect to the Cobas servers over TCP 3333:
These units will be assigned IP addresses on VLAN 243 so please make sure you have VLAN 243 ports available for these units.
The intake was missing the MAC addresses and MDS2.
Once the connectivity diagram has been verified, the MDS2 has been provided, and the MAC addresses have been given to me I will assign resources and a start date.
Let me know if you have any questions.

adamiano001 02-21-25 08:59:36: Good Morning Kevin - for project ID 2392 NHMC Beckman Coulter DxU 840 Workcell the technical design has been completed and attached here. No IPs or firewall rules were requested, this was for documentation only. You should be able to test this unit at your convenience.

adamiano001 02-21-25 08:32:50: This will be for documentation only, connecting through existing term server, port 4.

adamiano001 02-20-25 07:16:04: Kevin Deitch replied saying he wants this re-opened and that the devices will be on-site in April. Waiting to speak with Dusty and Dhaval about how this will connect before assigning resources and a start date.

adamiano001 10-29-24 08:38:01: Per Kevin Deitch: Hello Anthony - after a conversation with Marcus, Andrea and Dhaval, I was provided the information needed and they recommended closing the MDICI project - NHMC ID 2392 - for the time being and opening a new one or perhaps reopening this one when the instrument is on site.

adamiano001 10-24-24 07:52:35: Per Kevin Deitch - This instrument would ultimately replace the current Siemens device that connects to the lab term server as the NHMC_WAM_ORD and NHMC_WAM_RES devices.

adamiano001 10-23-24 16:16:54: Hello Kevin -
Your MDICI request has been received and assigned the following project number: ID 2392 NHMC Beckman Coulter DxU 840 Workcell
Before I can assign resources and a start date I need to know what this device will connect to. On the intake form it lists ""Cerner LIS"" but I need to know destination IP addresses and port numbers that will be used for communication if this unit will be assigned a TCP/IP address. Or will this device be connected through an already existing term server?
What system(s) will this device be connected to?
Cerner LIS
I will also need the MDS2 for this effort.
Once I have that information I'll assign resources and a start date. Let me know if you have any questions.",2025-02-21,2025-02-21,2025-06-09,Southern California,242.0,2025-03-14,Completed,,0.0,0.0,108.0,2025-10-21 05:30:07.580705,REMLCYB521

adamiano001 06-09-25 10:53:02: Response from Alex Yuan: Hi Teo seems like there is some missing vlan713 10.115.36.128/26 information  to complete this. Can you validate vlan713 is in BGP if needed can you create a ticket to add? Also can you create a request for dhcp scope and add the IP and MAC in the email chain. Anthony will create the request for DHCP IP helper at the FW, 10.253.204.26 & 10.253.193.30. Agg1/2 static route and L2 vlan713 is there. Po25 outside transit has vlan713 and looks to be no vlan pruning to the L2 switch.
Waiting on Teo to make this request before engaging firewall to request FW to add dhcp server to firewall cansc-2020court-mdf-fw1 dhcp relay of IP 10.253.204.26 and 10.253.193.30.

adamiano001 05-16-25 07:55:19 - Bulk Comment Update: Asked site for testing update. Response from Ned Estill: I’ve configured the device as required but have been unsuccessful in either querying the MWL or sending images to PACS. I suspect this has something to do with the device appearing to require an active connection to the Internet in order to login the user. It is possible to log into the device as a Guest without an internet connection, but this account is unable to execute any DICOM functions or adjust system settings.
Added Alex Yuan to the thread.

adamiano001 04-25-25 09:54:03 - Bulk Comment Update: Asked site for testing update. Response from Ned Estill: The testing for this is still in progress. Due to limited availability and access to the device each day, I will coordinate with the facility to complete it next week.

adamiano001 02-06-25 15:26:39: Per Jose Sanchez: During a recent meeting with Joe and the PACS team, it was brought to our attention that the bkSpecto device should not be sending images to our Radiology PACS. The reason for this is that there's an existing solution for the Gastroenterology department which is managed by the ClinApps Surgery team. The software solution is provided by Olympus and it's called VaultStream Easy Suite. The solution has their own VNA for image storage and other handy features which are outside my scope of knowledge at this time.
What this means is that there's a possibility that an MDICI might be needed to ask the ClinApps Surgery team to assess the onboarding of the bkSpecto currently residing in the GI Lab area. Wanted to make you aware of this before we continue down the path we thought would work prior to these news being known to us.

adamiano001 02-27-25 06:19:48: Per Chris Thompson with Baxter: I've added the local Account Executive (@Cieslinski, Lauren) to this email.  What I recall about the purchase of these devices was they were not purchased with connectivity.  The intent was stand-alone until more were purchased and would connect later.  That would mean there were no licenses purchased to connect these.  Configuration for these devices is completed in our configuration portal and that is something our team can work with you on, once services are purchased.

Because of this I've asked Wendy to open a project to make sure these devices have a configuration file so they are able to send to the required Cerner destination. To Wendy: Hi Wendy - regarding that email thread about ID 2478 MMCM Hillrom Vital Signs Monitor 7000 Series - it sounds like a project will need to be opened to get those devices to connect the way they need to.

If there is a need to revisit or reopen this in the future, please let me know.

Anthony Damiano <adamiano001>, 9/26/2024 6:52:14 AM:  Good Morning - is there any more information on if this project will continue through MDICI or if it's going to be installed through a different project?
Response from Bree: HI Anthony,
I have not heard anything further regarding this project from Randy or that Phil was able to get MAC info from the CD burner.  I do know that this burner will need to connect to a server, so it will ultimately need firewall rules and IP info assigned, but I think without the server info first, we can't progress any further.  I'll reach back out to Randy, but unless Phil has further information than I do, I would say we are at a pause until we have that server info.
Phil or Randy,
if you have further information on the status of the CD burner and/or server, please let us know.
___________________________________________________________
Anthony Damiano <adamiano001>, 9/12/2024 7:00:07 AM:  Team - is there any update on getting the MAC address for this MDICI effort? Do you still want to move forward with this install? RESPONSE from Bree:  My understanding is that Phil was going to attempt to get the MAC address for the CD burner with the help of a laptop.  That being said, the other part to and maybe required piece to this is that there is a ""workstation"" or ""server"" that we have requested from Randy and the IT project team, as the burner is engaged by this workstation and would need to be the piece of equipment that had firewall rules in place and connected singularly to the burner.
I've requested the project # from Randy so I can see if this could be handled by the Medical Imaging team.  I would say until we get the workstation/server in place, firewall rules may be not yet needed.

Anthony Damiano <adamiano001>, 10/9/2024 2:50:31 PM:  Good Afternoon - just a friendly reminder we need info for ID 2361 MGH GE Maxima regarding the system software version before I will assign resources and a start date so we know what remote support solution should be documented on the connectivity diagram and so the design and firewalls teams know what work needs to be done.
___________________________________________________________
Anthony Damiano <adamiano001>, 10/7/2024 2:05:28 PM:  Adding Joe McDonagh from Shared Imaging and Timothy Snyder from GE to hopefully answer this.
Joe and Timothy - for the GE Maxima being installed at Mercy General Hospital, 4001 J Street, Sacramento CA - will that need to be on the GE B2B VPN or will this connect to the InSite URLs for remote support?
___________________________________________________________
Anthony Damiano <adamiano001>, 10/7/2024 8:10:09 AM:  Good Morning - I'm still waiting on details around the remote support connection; B2B VPN or GE InSite URLs. Please let me know if you have any questions.
___________________________________________________________
Anthony Damiano <adamiano001>, 10/1/2024 11:22:24 AM:  Salil clarified it should be port 4000 not 400. Told site once we have clarification on the remote support connection I'll assign resources and a start date.
___________________________________________________________
Anthony Damiano <adamiano001>, 9/30/2024 11:30:42 PM:  Hello Salil -
Your MDICI request has been received and assigned the following project number: ID 2361 MGH GE Maxima
Below are the connections requested for the device. Please verify if this is correct, port 400 looks odd so I'm assuming that needs to be 4000:
What system(s) will this device be connected to?                  McKesson PACS; PACS MWL: AE: ALI_QUERY_SCP IP: 10.204.198.23 port: 5000;  PACS Send destination: AE: ALI_STORE_SCP IP 10.204.198.23 TCP Port:400  ;
Description/Name: ACR SAC
AE: ACR_SAC
IP: 10.202.200.33
Port: 104 ;
Name: GSSA Downtime
AE: GSSA_Downtime
IP:   10.204.200.107
Port:  11112
What is your PACS/CPACS vendor?       McKesson
What is the PACS Modality Worklist AE Title, IP address, and port this device will query for MWL?    PACS MWL: AE: ALI_QUERY_SCP IP: 10.204.198.23 port: 5000
What is the PACS AE Title, IP address, and port which will receive images from this device?            PACS Send destination: AE: ALI_STORE_SCP IP 10.204.198.23 TCP Port:400
You also put that this unit will need to connect to the GE B2B VPN so I'm including Joe M. from SharedImaging and Tim S. from GE:
If the device will be serviced remotely, can it be done using one of the following access methods:  B2B VPN
Tim or Joe - can you confirm if this needs a NAT IP and to be on the GE tunnel or will this reach out to the InSite URLs for remote support?
Salil - you did not upload the MDS2 document, I will need that and once I have all of the information from above I will assign resources and a start date.
Let me know if you have any questions.

What is the PACS AE Title, IP address, and port which will receive images from this device?         TBD
The MAC address was also missing:
If wireless will be the primary connection method, will a wired IP be required for back-up?             Per manufacturer: We would not have a record of the MAC of the probe.
The Vscan App will use the MAC of the mobile device to communicate to your network.
The Vscan probe will only connect to a Vscan App.
Device MAC address(es):          PENDING
I will need the MAC address from the tablet this unit is connecting to. I'm assuming it's a tablet owned by Dignity Health and if it is for all of these Vscan installs the tablet needs to have Mobile Device Management (Workspace One) installed on it before being deployed.
Please make sure you request a wireless service account for this device.
Once I have the PACS information and MAC address I will be able to assign resources and a start date.
Let me know if you have any questions.

adamiano001 01-13-25 08:23:58: Per Jai Johnson: During the testing, our Network Engineer found that IPs were not carved out for VLAN 713, however VLAN 600 with same security settings already existed at this clinic for these modalities. We worked with Robert Eckles(PACS Admin) who placed an ORDER and it was received in the Carestream worklist and was successfully resulted. Also, noted that this small rural clinic has no plans to add any modalities, therefore at the recommendations of the Network Engr, proceeded to leave this device on VLAN600. This week, 01/14 - 01/16 is onsite Carestream training for the users there. Once the training is completed, the new xray machine will be used on patients.

Good Afternoon -
On the MDICI submission Daniel answered ""yes"" to the questions below:
Will the device be serviced remotely?          Yes
Is the Vendor contracted for remote support?              Yes
Can someone provide the details around the remote support connection? I see this device is being supplied by Akumin and not GE so who is going to remotely support this piece of equipment and what does it need to connect to?
If you like we can start this project and move forward with only the internal connections and when you have the remote support information we can add that as another line item in the MDICI project list to update documentation and request new firewall rules.
Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.

Anthony Damiano <adamiano001>, 8/8/2024 9:25:59 AM:  Good Morning - I need the network share info and model name of the device that matches one on the MDS2.
___________________________________________________________
Anthony Damiano <adamiano001>, 8/6/2024 9:25:49 AM:  Hello Kenneth -
Your MDICI request has been received and assigned the following project number: ID 2315 METH Medtronic ManoScan ESO
Before I can assign resources and a start date I need some more information. I will need the MDS2 document for this device. If the vendor cannot provide that then this will need to be run as an OPW. If we do get the MDS2 I will also need the name of the shared folder that this unit will need to connect to:
What system(s) will this device be connected to?       Network Share
From a similar device installed on ID 2025 Terry Schuler had me use this share: ""\\crhdc01c\global$"" and I would need the IP address of that destination as well. We would request ports TCP 135 & 445 on the firewall for communication to the shared folder, let me know if you would need other ports as well.
From the screenshots you uploaded for the MAC addresses I believe we would use these two MACs, if these need to change let me know:
Device MAC address(es):         Wired: 74-86-E2-2A-7F-F5 / Wireless: C8-94-02-DB-93-99
I understand this will not be connected to PACS, correct?
Once I have this information I will assign resources.
Let me know if you have any questions.

You submitted three MDS2 documents, Cellavision DM, SP-50 and XN Series. Will all three of these devices need network connectivity? I understand the XN3100 and Cellavision will connect to your term servers but will they all need a separate TCP/IP connection to connect to Sysmex for remote support? What system(s) will this device be connected to? Term Server - Ports 11 and 13. 11 for Sysmex XN3100 and 13 for Cellavision I've included Zackery Sommer from Sysmex on this thread. I will need the MAC addresses of the units needing connectivity for remote support so we can assign IPs and firewall rules. Device MAC address(es): PENDING - Per Salil, okay to submit form without the mac address If the device will be serviced remotely, can it be done using one of the following access methods: Port 443 TLS Communications I'm also including the lab team, Dhaval, Dusty and Andrea on this thread. I imagine the connectivity diagram will look similar to this: MDICI Above 2100 - 2250.jpeg Please verify which units will need to have IPs assigned to them and provide the MAC addresses when you can. As soon as I understand the connectivity requirements for the devices I will assign resources and a start date. From the start date of the project it can take up to four weeks before the device is ready to test. Once this project is ready to test I will send out networking information with the technical design in a separate email. Let me know if you have any questions.

You submitted three MDS2 documents, Cellavision DM, SP-50 and XN Series. Will all three of these devices need network connectivity? I understand the XN3100 and Cellavision will connect to your term servers but will they all need a separate TCP/IP connection to connect to Sysmex for remote support? What system(s) will this device be connected to? Term Server - Ports 11 and 13. 11 for Sysmex XN3100 and 13 for Cellavision I've included Zackery Sommer from Sysmex on this thread. I will need the MAC addresses of the units needing connectivity for remote support so we can assign IPs and firewall rules. Device MAC address(es): PENDING - Per Salil, okay to submit form without the mac address If the device will be serviced remotely, can it be done using one of the following access methods: Port 443 TLS Communications I'm also including the lab team, Dhaval, Dusty and Andrea on this thread. I imagine the connectivity diagram will look similar to this: MDICI Above 2100 - 2250.jpeg Please verify which units will need to have IPs assigned to them and provide the MAC addresses when you can. As soon as I understand the connectivity requirements for the devices I will assign resources and a start date. From the start date of the project it can take up to four weeks before the device is ready to test. Once this project is ready to test I will send out networking information with the technical design in a separate email. Let me know if you have any questions.

Anthony Damiano , 10/14/2024 9:00:08 AM: Per Rob Harper: The site will need to engage Telcor on the new project as they will treat it as a net new connection to Telcor. I'm not part of the Demand process any longer and is coordinated by the DOG, but let me know if I can assist in any way.

Anthony Damiano , 10/13/2024 1:37:54 PM: Per Rob Harper: This would be treated as net new effort for point of care. I would get the Idea opened so it can be approved by the Dog and get a demand manager assigned. The project will also require Telcor and so they will need to be engaged with a project request. The site should be able to open this ticket to get their invoice requested. I hope this helps.

Anthony Damiano , 4/22/2024 6:46:29 AM: Good Morning - I've cancelled this project out of the MDICI queue as I understand these will be getting installed through the DOG team's IDEA process. ___________________________________________________________
Anthony Damiano , 4/15/2024 9:11:18 AM: I think there is some confusion whether a Siemens server is needed or if these are going to Telcor. If these ePoc devices just need network connectivity to Telcor we can help assign IP addresses and firewall rules to the Telcor server while the interface is being built and when it's done then you can test connectivity. But if a Siemens server is needed to then connect to Telcor I would think getting the Siemens server and ePoc devices taken care of under an IDEA would be the easiest route for implementation. ___________________________________________________________
Anthony Damiano , 4/15/2024 8:03:32 AM: Good Morning - I'm still waiting on clarification on the network requirements for how these devices will be connected. Is the diagram below accurate? Please let me know what changes need to be made and provide the ports that would be used to connect to the Telcor servers. I'm also unsure of how these would be connected to MCMDLAB19:

Unknown Will Instrument Connect Through Middleware: (i.e. Telcor or RALS - please specify) Unknown If the device requires integration with an application/workstation/device select 2 of the following: New system workstation/device, Needs to be added to the network Working on a few of these Sysmex installs recently I would assume that we need to get an IP assigned and firewall rules in place to allow connectivity for remote support. I've added a few people to this thread that can hopefully let me know if this will also connect to a term server and then to Cerner. Here is how I imagine the device will need to connect: > If this looks correct I will need the MAC address of the XN unit. If this is also connecting through a term server to Cerner I would like that information to have the Design Engineer document on their technical design. Once I have all of that information I will assign resources and a start date. From the start date of the project it can take up to four weeks before the device is ready to test. Once this project is ready to test I will send out networking information with the technical design in a separate email. Let me know if you have any questions. ___________________________________________________________",2024-07-01,2024-06-14,2024-10-04,Northern California,498.0,2024-06-28,Completed,,21.0,4.0,116.0,2025-10-21 05:30:07.580705,REMLCYB521

So rather than hunting down available IPs, I will convert the IPs already assigned to these devices. then map them out in the sheet. It will take time to map them to IP in sheet for documentation, but the IPs will already be online and reserved. Based on the lease info the IPs are randomly assigned between 10.149.87.21 to 10.149.87.65 I will export the IPs from the leases that will show which MACs are assigned to which IPs, then attach and send on in task. ___________________________________________________________

From what I understand, Sonosite does not sell this platform which also would include the selling of options. The users can, in theory, transfer the studies to a jump drive then transfer them to PACS but I doubt we would want to do that for cybersecurity reasons. ___________________________________________________________ Anthony Damiano , 5/17/2024 12:50:15 PM: ___________________________________________________________ Anthony Damiano , 5/15/2024 3:19:22 PM: Testing info sent to site. ___________________________________________________________ Anthony Damiano , 5/14/2024 12:00:24 PM: Modality onboarding: REQ4427198 ___________________________________________________________",2024-05-15,2024-05-14,2024-05-17,Southwest,526.0,2024-05-31,Cancelled,,2.0,1.0,4.0,2025-10-21 05:30:07.580705,REMLCYB521

Anthony Damiano , 4/18/2024 11:10:05 AM:  Hi Laura,
A new MDICI project request was put into the system under ALM ID 2175 AZGH Glendale Quidel Triage Meter Pro.
Below is the information put on the intake form for systems this project will need to communicate with:
What other devices/workstations will this specific device need to talk to (if any):          Triage 2 - 10.248.16.55 Port 10001
From the past AZGH Triage Meter Installs I see they were connected to a Lantronix Box and directly connected to Cerner. I just want to make sure this is correct before we assign resources and a start date.

I met with Andrea and Dhaval this morning and understand I will help get the remote support connection in place but the connection to Cerner will go through a term server and that should already be in place and will be documented on the design. So once I get the MAC addresses we can begin assigning IP addresses and firewall rules.

However the DI-60 was not yet ready, so we were not able to test the connections related to the DI-60. The vendor has also pushed back the date they will be back on site to 6/24. Additionally, Sysmex is now requesting to add a 3rd data connection for remote access. They want to connect the SP-50 Slide Maker to the network. MAC address: 58-38-79-9B-2D-40. Would you please set up another VLAN243 IP address for the SP-50? ___________________________________________________________ Bulk Comment Update 5/28/2024 1:24:50 PM: 05/30/24 @0700 - Asked site for testing update. ___________________________________________________________ Anthony Damiano , 5/24/2024 8:29:59 AM: XN portion connected yesterday. ___________________________________________________________ Anthony Damiano , 5/13/2024 11:27:00 AM: From Jonas Artus: Good morning, The Sysmex analyzer is scheduled to arrive at MGH on May 20, and the vendor specialist will be on site for the setup on May 21 thru 24.

Below is the information put on the intake form for systems this project will need to communicate with: What is your PACS/CPACS vendor? Merge What is the PACS Modality Worklist AE Title, IP address, and port this device will query for MWL? TBD What is the PACS AE Title, IP address, and port which will receive images from this device? TBD Additional comments: Please mirror existing Philips EPIQ Ultrasound machines that we currently have I will need someone to verify the PACS destination(s) this unit will need to communicate with. This unit will be getting a wireless IP address only as only one MAC address was provided, is that correct? Primary connection method: Wireless Device MAC address(es): 3C:55:76:3F:B1:61 The Clinical Engineering Manager was listed as Aaron Alonzo, let me know if this should be changed (Thomas Tims?): Name of Clinical Engineering Manager for this Location Aaron Alonzo And last, the ""Site point of contact for testing"" was listed as ""Katy Philips"" but the only Katy Philips I find in the GAL is in Seattle. I'm assuming this should be ""Kathleen Phillips"" and have CC'd her but let me know if that's not correct: Site Point of Contact for Questions regarding workflow/use/testing: Katy Phillips changed to ""Kathleen Phillips"" Once this information has been verified I will assign resources and a start date.

Currently, I am waiting for a Technical Design to complete this assessment, but the team cannot obtain a TD until this is converted into an actual project. So Sheetal Patel will work on converting this 'Demand' (Demand #: DMND0002639) to an actual project in order to get the TD.

Below is the information put on the intake form for systems this project will need to communicate with: What is your PACS/CPACS vendor? MERGE What is the PACS Modality Worklist AE Title, IP address, and port this device will query for MWL?TBD What is the PACS AE Title, IP address, and port which will receive images from this device? TBD Additional comments: For Remote Service: Communication between the Ultrasound system and the infrastructure is encrypted. The encryption technology used is HTTPS and WebSocket. For Kinectus functionality, the customer network requires only one open outbound port (443) to a single endpoint if proxy access is allowed. If proxy access is not allowed (blocked), the customer network requires only one open outbound port (443) to any IP address. Our firewall team will not add a rule that is wide open over port 443. If this device needs to communicate outside of our network we will need specific IPs or URLs and ports the device will use for communication. I added Gregg Quintos from Siemens to this thread hoping he can provide more details around this. Gregg - is there an ""IT Whitelisting"" document for ""Kinectus"" or can you provide specific connections this device will need outside of the hospital network? Once I have the PACS and outside connectivity details I will assign resources and a start date.

Anthony Damiano , 3/11/2024 7:44:02 AM:  Good Morning - Melissa, Rob and I were chatting about this a few weeks ago and it seemed like this would be going through a project to get everything connected:
""Its good its in the backlog and being worked on as DMND0002931... For point of care to get it approved, funded, with MDI Design/firewall , and application build it is an entire scope of work for this modality. I'm not sure if their is further facility work needed with Data drops. The validation time /Change control time frame I see about adding 2-3 weeks. I would estimate whatever the start date is 10-12 weeks. It seems like this is container level project, although with that many instruments I'm kind of running on a PM to run.""
With that information I believe this project should be cancelled out of the MDICI queue. I will close this towards the end of the week. Let me know if you have any questions.
___________________________________________________________
Anthony Damiano , 2/15/2024 6:55:48 AM:  Good Morning - is there a plan for this? Will my team be in charge of assigning IP addresses and requesting firewall rules? If yes, do we have an ETA on getting the MAC addresses?

Anthony Damiano , 12/18/2023 8:27:13 AM:  From my email: ""Melissa - do you have any of that information for Rob? It sounds like you need funding and a design to implement the GemWeb Plus application interface with Cerner.
I can get IPs and firewall rules in place for connectivity from the Hemochrons to the GemWeb once you have the MAC addresses. Can you verify if the below diagram is correct? I'll need to know ports and the GemWeb server IP address.""
___________________________________________________________
Anthony Damiano , 12/15/2023 7:35:21 AM:  Good Morning - so will this entire project be taken care of as an OPW? Or should I keep this open in the MDICI queue so when we get MAC addresses we can assign IPs and get firewall rules in place to communicate with the GemWeb server?

Your project has been entered into ALM as: ID 2140 METH Hillrom Connex Vital Signs Monitor 6800
This intake was missing the MAC addresses and connectivity information. Looking at a previous Connex installation under MDICI ID 1310 METH Welch Allyn/Hillrom Connex 6000 I see the devices were connected as shown below:
Will these new devices need to connect the same way? If the connectivity diagram needs to change please let me know so the design engineers get the correct information. I would usually go to Barb West for this information but it looks like she's no longer with the organization so I'm not sure who I'd contact to verify this information.
Please let me know if you have any questions.

I also need the details about the connection these units need. The intake mentions ""TELCOR TO CERNER"" but I will need the IP address and ports used for communication. I imagine the connection will be as shown below but need the details for the text in red confirmed: Will we need wired and wireless IP addresses? Are the Telcor destinations correct? Will they then connect to Cerner CareB or ECISA? Once I have all of these details I will assign resources and a start date. From the start date of the project it can take up to four weeks before the device is ready to test.

Anthony Damiano , 2/5/2024 6:58:27 AM:  Good Morning - is there an update on this unit? It's been a while so I wanted to make sure I have the PACS information correct, it looks like we may be missing some details if someone can make sure the information below is correct:
What is your PACS/CPACS vendor?       Merge
What is the PACS Modality Worklist AE Title, IP address, and port this device will query for MWL?      22DRS522SP
10.37.22.103
Port 104
What is the PACS AE Title, IP address, and port which will receive images from this device? TBD
Will this be in the main building or in the neuro tower? We need to know this so we get an IP assigned on the correct VLAN, 713 or 2713.
Is the connection to Philips Remote Support going to need the ports listed below?

If this all looks correct I can get an IP address ahead of time. Once these details are verified I will assign a Design Engineer to start working on this.

A new MDICI project request was put into the system under ALM ID 2084 SJHMC Roche Cobas e411 (via Fortigate).
From past Fortigate installs I want to make sure these are the connections needed for your Fortigate, please include someone from Roche who can verify this is correct for their connectivity needs:
MDICI Random Diagrams - 2084 SJHMC.jpeg
This will also need a VLAN 2243 IP address, correct?
Once these details have been verified I will assign resources and a start date.
Thank you for your help,

Hoping to kick off the project - three EMGs within outpatient clinic that are going away, these are replacing them.
Cerner interface needed for these - is there a project open to build the Cerner interface? From Jose: Quote should be coming for bi-directional interface for this to be built.
Integrating with PACS or only the Cadlink Server?
Cadlink allows data to sync between the units. Cadlink also allows unit to sync settings.
Per Sean Clifford - he is going to open an OPW to get this online through an OPW rather than MDICI since we are waiting on a Cerner interface to be built and there will need to be bi-directional connectivity to that and a connection to the CadLink server.

Anthony Damiano , 11/29/2023 1:22:08 PM:  Asked site to verify that SecureLink is the only connection needed for this device and to verify the MAC address before we assign resources and a start date. RESPONSE from Jane Johnson: Yes, SecureLink is the only connection needed for this device.
Is there a specific VLAN you'd like this to go on to match other Cadwell EEGs in your facility?   NO, Do Not Place on EEG vlan
Does Cadwell already have a SecureLink login to access the system once it's connected to the network?   Cadwell EEG support division has SecureLink access, Cadwell EMG support division does not.

So my question is: will the Merge Hemodynamics system need to connect to the Philips IR over the network? If yes, what ports would need to be opened on the firewall to allow that communication? It was also requested that the system be allowed to communicate with Merge PACS if you could verify that this would be correct: ___________________________________________________________

Anthony Damiano , 1/23/2024 1:47:31 PM:  Reply from Marcello: The Network Security team is not funded to absorb the costs of purchasing and installing firewalls for such efforts. I say we forego the firewall in this case and install the imaging device on the trusted zone.

Both of these would need connectivity to Cerner CareAware iBus, correct?
Are they going through connectivity engines or would they be plugged directly into an ethernet port to connect to Cerner? On the V800 intake you mentioned connectivity engines.
If they are going directly on to the hospital network both of the intakes were missing MAC addresses for these units. If they are plugging in to and communicating through connectivity engines I would assume those are already on the network and capable of communicating with Cerner?
Is there already a Cerner interface built to accept the data from these units for your facility?
If yes, do you have the destination details for Cerner; IP address(es) and what ports will be used for communication?

Anthony Damiano <adamiano001>, 1/11/2024 10:04:38 AM:  From Andrew Gilchrist: Saint Rose Siena Team,
Good morning.  I have attached the meeting minutes as well as forecasted project timeline below from our meeting yesterday.
There are a few things to highlight.
We have confirmed TAS for 26 Feb 2024 to begin the instrument integration.  It should last approximately 20-30 business days.
@nancy.villarosa@commonspirit.org – Don is going to work with you on placing the integration order sometime in the late January or early February timeframe to ensure the reagents and consumables arrive onsite in time for integration.
LIS Mapping is complete by Cerner – once we complete the integration of the instruments and the configuration of the instrument to LIS we should be able to move immediately into Wet testing.

No Resource,2006,,SF Bay Area,SEQ,Cancelled,BMDI,2023-11-01,ID 2006 SEQ Circinus Bolt Navigation System,1,Pending information from the site.,William Lee / Kelly Nicholson / Ronald Cyr,"Anthony Damiano , 11/1/2023 4:16:42 PM:  Good afternoon:
As foundation, the device is a standalone iOS device (7th generation iPod touch).  It is provisioned at the factory via an MDM server (Jamf) such that it only has the Bolt Navigation program on it.  There is no access to any other programs on the device.  The Bolt program is native on the device and requires no connectivity to function.  The only time that it could theoretically be required to connect to the internet is if / when a program update is available.  In this case, notice will be sent to the customer with specific instructions to connect to a secure internet connection.  (Note that this connection can be outside of the hospital.)  As soon as the device connects to the interned it will receive the update via the MDM server.  It can then be disconnected again from the internet.
Having said this, the current proposal is for a two-month trial of the system.  In this two months there will not be any updates and therefor no connectivity is required.  (We anticipate that updates will be on an annual basis in the future.)
Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Good Morning - I spoke with Rob Harper today and there is now a project open for this effort under: 1012692. The middleware design needs to be completed before we can move forward with getting the TEG 6s units connected to that.
Please work with Rob for further build effort. I have moved this MDICI effort to ""hold"" and will follow up in early 2024 to check the status of the middleware build.

Anthony Damiano , 7/29/2023 11:12:00 AM:  From Marcus: this is for the Vitek PC only. The Vitek PC will communicate to the Myla VM, which is being handled by a PRM we have.
Asked Marcus to confirm connectivity diagram, provide the Vitek MDS2 and Myla connectivity information.
___________________________________________________________
Anthony Damiano , 7/21/2023 8:18:42 AM:  Asked Marcus to clarify why this needs to be an MDICI project if it is already going through an OPW: 1014392- Migrate from bioMérieux's OBSERVA to MYLA HP PC solution. This effort also required existing VITEK to be placed on the network in order to communicate with MYLA HP PC.
___________________________________________________________
Anthony Damiano , 7/18/2023 2:26:45 PM:  Email sent to the site to clarify how this device needs to connect:
Hi Nadia,
A new MDICI project request was put into the system under ALM ID 1908 SJRMC Biomerieux Myla Virtual Machine.
Below is the information put on the intake form for systems this project will need to communicate with:
What system(s) will this device be connected to?         CERNER
I'm assuming this will be Cerner iBus ECISA as on the other SJRMC lab projects?
I would also need to know what ports are needed for communications.
Will existing lab devices connect to the Myla VM and the Myla will then connect to Cerner as shown below?
The intake said one device but two MAC addresses were provided. Is it one Myla VM or two and are those both wired connections?
Are these physical computers being purchased that are being installed?
<>
The file you uploaded is not the MDS2 document for this system which is needed for an MDICI project. I've CC'd Sommer Babcock from Biomerieux onto this email who may be able to help answer some of these questions.
Once I understand what is needed for connectivity and have the MDS2 I can assign resources and a start date.
Thank you for your help

I've ordered an HDMI-> DP adapter to try that port as a workaround. Still waiting on that adapter to come in. The display only accepts VGA or DP, so I can't go HDMI straight into the monitor. I'm optimistic that the HDMI port will get us going without needing a major PC repair/replacement etc, and will let you know as soon as the part comes in and I can check it out."" ___________________________________________________________ Anthony Damiano , 8/2/2023 8:09:34 AM: Response from Peter Kulak - "":Hi Anthony, Last week I forwarded the IP information for the MSJMC Optos Monaco P200TE (ID 1839) and met with Chris Nauta (Clinical Engineering).

Anthony Damiano , 7/28/2023 9:35:19 AM:  Asked Dusty to clarify what ports need to be checked for communication to Cerner. From my email:
Hi Dusty - +Walt Wolf -TX worked on the firewall rules under REQ3076485. As we have in the design the source IP addresses 10.203.211.133 & 10.201.211.134 need to communicate with the following destinations:
159.140.67.9
159.140.61.30
159.140.61.41
using ports: 3506, 3510, 3520
Does that all look correct? Are there any ports that need to be checked or added to this? Do you want Walt to check for traffic on these ports or to check for any ""denies"" in general to those destination IP addresses?

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help move this project towards completion. If we receive no response from the site we are moving to close these aging projects in the MDICI queue. RESPONSE: we are awaiting the DTRS to make the change for this last Fuji CR processor.  It is also very old, and after evaluating the needed changes with the vendor, they recommend that we make both the IP change on the modality as well as the destination sending configuration changes at the same time instead of separately.  We are in the end stages of getting access to the DTRS.

Bulk Comment Update  3/14/2023 8:03:43 AM: 03/16/23 - Asked site for testing update. RESPONSE: DTRS needs to be connected first, to happen within a few weeks.

Bulk Comment Update  4/5/2023 8:12:07 AM: 4/6/23 - Asked site for testing update. RESPOSNE:  We are setting up the DTRS today.  Once set up, we'll work to get the OEC9800 connected to the DTRS, and will report back as to whether we were able to then get the OEC9800 connected without needing a gateway.  We still have one other last stitch effort to try if that option doesn't work also.
___________________________________________________________
Anthony Damiano , 4/3/2023 6:43:56 AM:  Hello - testing information was sent out for the project below more than 90 days ago. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help move this project towards completion. If we receive no response from the site we are moving to close these aging projects in the MDICI queue. RESPONSE: this modality does not accept a gateway as it is a much older model C-Arm, we are holding onto a hope that the DTRS implementation may allow us to get around this issue.  The DTRS is in its end stages of being stood up.  If that does not work, then we will need to discuss with Radiology leadership the retirement of the modality.

RESPONSE from Sean Knox: we're effectively testing two workflows on the sequencer; Illumina Basespace Hub (online sequencer repository) and internal SMB share access (internal sequencer repository). The Biobank team is assisting with creating test sequences for transfer. At this point, I've decided to pivot the device to utilize a BNI subnet/VLAN rather than keep it on the semi-trusted SJHMC VLAN. Sequencer data will land on the BNI netapp (bnicluster1). Basespace can be utilized after transfer to the netapp, depending upon the needs of the department. I'll fire out an update once I get the thumbs up from the department so that we can close this project out.

Lenczewski, Michael - PHX , 5/10/2021 3:21:44 PM:  Per the vendor: Remote Access Solution - Compliance Questions
1) Does the vendor have a contract (BAA if PHI present) with CommonSpirit Health? @Jaber, Majid do you know where we are at with this?
2) Can remote support access/actions be logged with a unique identifier, date and time and relevant source/destination for data transmissions? Medtronic support personnel have unique login. All access and activity is logged. From the customer side, this will utilize the authentication method of the device. The Customer must accept and choose our level of access when initiating a session.
3) Does CommonSpirit Health have an identified business or technical owner that can produce on demand on premise logs or for hosted systems document how to obtain copies of logs, log reports, and/or review reports? Logs are available upon request, your local Medtronic Rep will be the point of contact.
4) Does all traffic use end-to-end data encryption where there is no intermediate decryption of the transmission by the third-party tool provider if the traffic traverses a public network? Yes
5) Does the remote access require a unique username/password or the ability to log all accesses to a unique vendor username? Yes
6) For shared desktop sessions can CommonSpirit Health manually initiate /accept to allow remote access? Yes, session must be initiated by Common Spirit
7) Does the solution encrypt all data, including passwords end to end, when it is transmitted across the internet (does not use FTP, Telnet, SMTP, HTTP, POP3, SQL, NETB, etc.)? Yes
8) Is sensitive data encrypted in transmission outside of CommonSpirit Health's network using secure protocols such as SFTP or HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or later)? Yes, data is encrypted with TLS 1.2

2- what are the URLs of the vendor hosted portal servers? https://oncall.spectros.com/app/login?next=/app/backpanel
3- how the patient will be identified on the portal? Data listed by T-Stat S/N, so surgeon needs to note which S/N is on each pt.   We do have a nickname function to help this, most surgeons choose their name, surgery date and hospital, for example “Matatov 12/16 DV”
4- will the users login leverage our AD/DUO? What is AD/DUO? No

Lenczewski, Michael - PHX , 11/17/2020 8:33:33 AM:  per the vendor: 1.     URL that will receive the error log file and process of this manual send? Error log files collected via the Smart Services interface reside on the local Site Control Unit (SCU) local on your network.   Qualified USA ZEISS engineers trained on the device can access the SCU remotely via our central service.  The endpoint IP for our central service is 52.166.68.247.  Please refer to the attached Smart Services security whitepaper for additional details.
2.      Will the service use port?  Port 443 is used for communication between the Central Server and the SCU.
3.      Provide a list of the information contained in this error log file in order to establish a classification of data sensitivity.  There is no PII or PHI data in the service log file.  Information in the service log file is: system configuration logs, subsystem event and status logs, error logs.

Please note that since there is a vendor portal involved that need assessment as well, the request may be out-side the scope of BMDI

Hi Rajwinder,
I am assessing the request to connect the analyzer, where there are few points that need further clarification
need for new Lantronics:I assume the analyzer connects via Serial ports, correct?
are buying the new lantronics?
Do you need to connect to any middle ware such as GEMWeb Server, cardio solution, etc…

Will the analyzer be directly connected with a cable to the Cisco Security Appliance? Yes, the Cisco Appliance is considered a component of the Echo Lumena.Will the Cisco Security Appliance installed by Vendor inside the analyzer? No, we install the device near or around the analyzer depending on available space.If inside the analyzer, how 2 analyzers will use single appliance in CRMC? Not applicable
Will the Cisco Security Appliance installed by Vendor outside the analyzer? YesWhere will it be installed then? Near or around the analyzer depending on available space.
Will it be physically secured in enclosure to prevent access? At the discretion of the facility, Immucor does not provide an enclosure.
Will the analyzer be directly connected via network to the Cisco Security Appliance? We NAT the analyzers behind the cisco device in a 192.168.1.x network, the cisco then speaks on behalf of the analyzer(s) into the network.

Lenczewski, Michael - PHX , 5/12/2020 10:47:28 AM: Per Jason: While I do not have access to ED patient volumes.   Based on the Physician ordering patterns and the Radiology study volumes at the SM ED I can conjecture that the patient volumes only averages about 100 patients a day so 33 per day would be very high.   At the same time 33 per month seems low to me.  That would only be about 1.5% of their volumes.  I would think a realistic number would be about 10 to 12 per day.
The study size of 149 mb is a number I came calculated by using the average US image size for those currently being stored from other US machines and the proposed usage by the physician.  This could change significantly if they store more than 1 3 second cine clip as Dr Bennett told us would be done.  Unfortunately as this is going to be controlled by the ED physicians and not internally in Radiology I have no better information on what to expect.
Takla, George - PHX , 5/12/2020: Sent the defect to Jason.Springgate@DignityHealth.org with comment:
Hi Jason,

Hi Michael,
The requests states connectivity using ethernet, but the vendor document states serial if connecting to customer LIS (ethernet is used to connect to BD system)
it seems we need to meet with vendor and business to wrap up the solution quickly
Thanks

As a recap, our “Aipark” Redding clinic had an Affiniti 70 US machine that wasn’t on the network. It was moved to the “Eureka Way” Redding clinic and planned to be put on the network and you helped get an IP address (10.115.16.234) and firewall rules assigned to it. I was just told Friday that the clinic wants to move their US tech and move the Affiniti US machine back to the Airpark clinic to perform exams there instead. The Airpark clinic has an imaging related semi-trusted network behind a firewall (VLAN 10.115.17.xxx). So, the 10.115.16.234 IP address was never used at Eureka Way and instead we need the project adjusted for the device to be at Airpark on the 10.115.117.xxx subnet. I know this change in plans is rather annoying so I’m sorry so be asking to open it back up for changes, but can we request an IP and firewall on this other network instead?

Hi Matt,
I learned from Michael that you are working on Ensite Presceion install in your facility.
My understanding that is the plan to send the studies to LTA directly (not PACS) and I have couple of questions
1- is there a defined clinical workflow to retrieve this study directly from LTA?
2- can you advise on the estimate of study size?
Thanks
George

Hi James,
I conducted intial assessment for the request and I found out that B2B remote support is requested while it does not currenlty exist
Unless B2B exists, the only remote support option to setup is ""SecureLink"" or someone in the facility to host a webEx for the vendor.
With that said please advise on remote support if the facility currenlty have B2B with Carestream or vendor can use Securelink

Hi,
I conducted the initial assessement of this request and have a follow up question.
I noticed the estimate study average size is 5MB. in other Fuij Sonosite, the average size was estimated at 500MB.
I will move forward using 500MB unless we need to dial it down to 5MB.
Thanks

2- do you plan to connect the EEG to other admin workstation? if yes, please provide the IPs of the workstations
3- We worked with Richared Ziman to setup the network in Stockton clinic (PV 1005665) or EEG. is the network established in METH for EEG?

a- is it expected to connect the O-Arm to StealthWorkstation?
b-if yes, please advise of existing IP or if it is new one
2- remote support:
a- the prior design for MSJ indicated use of internet not VPN for remote support. please advise of any change
3- daily volume
a- does the site perform 100 studies a day at average 30MB each?
b- does the site perform 30 studies a day at average 100MB each?
Thanks
George

Lenczewski, Michael - PHX , 12/18/2019 10:44:49 AM:  Per Jessie: Philips has not provided the test results of their firmware update validating SHA-512 authentication. I requested confirmation of compatibility with SHA-512 or SHA-256 by 12/23/19.  We need to get these devices on the network within the next few weeks (prior to cabling for CHSB Hemo project) and expect that we will need to make an exception for SHA-256.

Lenczewski, Michael - PHX , 11/13/2019 2:51:11 PM:  2 units successfully connected to the network/PACS using the WIRED IPs. Unfortunately it sounds like the facility will need a firmware update that changes the authentication method from SHA-256 to SHA-512 before connecting them to the WIRELESS network. Testing for SHA-512 authentication is scheduled 11/15/2019. Philips is now aware that SHA-512 is a DH standard.

We need the MDS2 for this device.
I recognize that device is in the network, but the project was completed in 2016 (PPM 195757) when security assessement was different and MDS2 form is not avaiable on the project archive directory

Lenczewski, Michael - PHX , 11/1/2019 12:53:11 PM:  Pending the following information:The request was for two new replacement carts, but from a few e-mail exchanges it sounds like the facility is requesting 4 IPs on the semi-trusted network to move the two existing carts to the semi-trusted. The additional 2 IPs are fine but I just want to make sure we are getting the correct number of IPs so the proper firewall rules can be put in place. It sounds like the 2 carts that were supposed to be replaced are not actually getting replaced, or is there a total of 4 older carts currently at the facility and 2 are getting replaced with the two new carts and the remaining older two will get moved to semi-trusted also?
In the SA design it shows a connection to the Madera B2B. If that is needed we will need the B2B information and we will need to request NAT’d IPs.
Worklist- Will the devices be pulling a worklist? If so, we need that information.

Lenczewski, Michael - PHX , 12/4/2019 10:32:41 AM:  TD pending the following: The intake form only lists a single PACS system (10.111.210.20) that the new Biosense Webster Carto 3 will communicate with and it only lists a single port for images to be sent over (port 104).  Can you please tell me what port the Carto 3 will query worklists on?
The intake form also states that there are no other systems the Carto 3 will need to talk to, but in the design complete by the SA I see a couple other systems listed, such as a ‘Siemens P500 Ultrasound’.  Can you please verify the other systems this new device will need to talk to, and if there are any can you please proved the IPs of the devices and the ports they will talk over?
Can you also please send me the MAC address of the device as that is required for IP assignment?

Takla, George - PHX , 10/16/2019 9:45:05 AM:  Per communication with super user  Stephen Sorensen  and vendor rep Abkemeier, Anthony ;
1- the Oncentra server (10.152.150.129)  is currently in operation and configured at St. Joe’s with the current MicreSelectron HDR,
2- Current MicreSelectron HDR uses a shared folder on the Oncentra server which the MicroSelectron maps to get the treatment file.
3- Flexitron that would be installed at St. Joe’s in place of the MicroSelectron, we could use the current MicroSelectron ip address. The difference in communication being the Oncentra server exports a plan via dicom TCP port 104 to the Flexitron instead of using a shared folder.
on those notes, I completed the solution but pending upload document to complete  resources when assigned

Hi Eddie,
I reached out to my engineer and here is the response to your questions…
1- I noticed the OS is Windows 7 on this device from the MDS2 form. Can the vendor provides the device with Windows 10?
- Windows 10 scheduled to be released in 2021
2- Does CARTO3 CathLab workstation use local account on the workstation to login or an AD account is used?
-Local account
Please let me know if you have any further questions.

However, the MDS2 provided with this project is for Philips Epiq CVx/CVxi that uses Windows Embedded Std 7 SP1
Please advise on the Epiq edition and relevant MDS2 form.

1. The device owner/operator could apply device manufacturer-validated security patches if trained on the system (Siemens
Service Training course) and if service password to log-in to the system is disclosed. Typically, patches are installed by
Siemens field-service engineers based upon maintenance contracts or safety-related updates issued.
12. Trend Micro virus scanner including the ongoing provision of updates via a remote connection is the only virus scanner
released for installation and is part of the optional Siemens Virus Protection offer.

Lantronix device details where this analyzer is going to connect – We worked with the lab team and have ordered the Cerner Middleware servers which should be onsite this week.  We’ll need to work on getting an IP address for those devices which I’m hoping can included in this effort.
Port information – Do not have at this time, when the middleware devices are installed we can determine the port to use.
Beckman Coulter Iris IQ2000 device MAC ID. – It was my understanding we’d be using a serial connection through the Cerner middleware server so a MAC address wouldn’t be needed.  If I am mistaken let me know.

Solution is completed per Dhaval input on 10/30/2019
the intake states connect to ""Expert"" middleware that supports 4 devices. where is the ""Expert"" system? – So Expert is the middleware currently in-use(connected to Lantronix server IP 10.203.208.19, Port 10008)
what means does the analyzer use to connect to the ""Expert"" system?
i) serial terminal server,
ii) direct USB/serial cable, or
iii) other mean - please explain –In most cases 2 instruments(Stago Max) connects to Expert middleware by RS232 adaptor.

Takla, George - PHX , 9/26/2019: Sent the defect to Kateryn.Earsley@DignityHealth.org with comment: Hi Kate,
According to other Stago Max projects, the analyzer connects to a terminal server such as Lantronix not direcrtly to the network.
if this is the same case at WHC for the replacement analyzer, we will need  the curent port number on the wall used for wired connection
Thanks

In the testing I found that the collections for the Arterial order were not set up for your facility properly in that the flexing had been set up on the order format so that it could not automatically collect.  This is also happening to all your nursing units for this order.  This order format should not be flexed for the order to work properly. I have seen this happen before for SEQ and not sure why it continues to happen.   I corrected flexing for a couple of the nursing locations (actually recommend it be removed), so testing needs to be repeated either for an OR or Rad registered patient location.

Hi Andrew,
1-Is there another un-trusted network (not Semitrusted or VLAN199) that CT uses to communicate with its components?
2- if ithe answer to point 1 is yes, would it make sence to connect the Contrast Injector to it?
3- what is Virtual care and how the attached document related to the injector listed in the intake?
4- MDS2 form is needed
Please advise

I reviewed this project.
I found out that is it not a medical device but software installation on a standard PC and it requires access or installation (not clear yet) to SQL Server.
The MDICI program addresses medical device that is a single unit that require IP, FW rules, and special consideration for OS/AV patching.
With that said, please clarify
1- would this request be managed in MDICI, regular OPW, or ticket?
2- The requirements does not include accessing any of our system; except having SQL database. Is the intake process complete, or should we wait till business complete the form?

Hi Richard,
Can you advise on the following
how the PFT Machine will authenticate to gain access to Epiphany share?
What is the share name used? Is it the same as Mortara QStress?
Thanks
George
___________________________________________________________
Takla, George - PHX , 10/1/2019: Sent the defect to Marianne.Shaw@DignityHealth.org with comment: Hi Marianne,
According to another implementation of the PFT machine in WHC as a project (PV
1003802), I noticed the following
1- the device can receive orders but that requires a server and database to process HL7 messages
2- the device can send the results to Epiphany as a file without any needs for servers
with that said, please advise if you need to receive orders hence the scope will change.
Thanks
George

Per Tanya
We need to find out some things and get some direction about this project.  The intake is from May so we need to act pretty fast.  This is a very simplistic instrument that is no typically interfaced.
This is the first interface for this device – so it would be a project?
Does Cerner have a driver for this instrument?
If not, how long does it take for Cerner to develop the driver?
Does the site want to proceed with this as a project with additional time and expense?
Let me know about next steps.

Barrett, Tanya - PHX , 8/23/2019 9:13:51 AM:  Matthew Peters (Telcor) meeting today.  Agenda attached.
Per Moses...4 iStat downloaders have been connected using IP addresses previously assigned to them.  The 5th device only has a MAC address listed so he wants to find out if there is an IP assigned for that device.  If not they will need that IP.
MAC address for the device that needs an IP assigned: c0a26doo6fbb

This ticket has 5 devices but I've been informed they have IP for 4 of them already.  The 5th device did not have an IP address sticker on it so they aren't sure but they believe they need an IP for that one.
MAC:  c0a26doo6fbb

Hi Anthony,
The rules were deployed last Thursday. When they were testing last Fri, I sow in my Fw packets dropping . Therefore, I have to adjust the interface in the Firewall after 5.00 pm.
I will send an email as soon as I am done,
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Good morning Pratyusha, we tested the RAP box this morning but were not able to establish a connection. Can you verify the firewall rules were update last night.
Thank you

Hi Jose-
I am confused on some of your entries in the intake form…
You note a MAC address – is that for the CT Scanner? Yes that MAC Address I entered is for the CT Scanner.
You note an IP – is that for the CT Scanner? (how did you get it?)  Yes, I worked with the EUS Lead to create a IP Reservation for his IP address.
I definitely need the PACS info.  Typically the device does not integration with Cerner but sends/receives from PACS.If I recall correctly, CHMC is using Merge Unity for PACS – so I think you will need to provide the digate server (workstation) information for connectivity.  I have an email to the Radiology Director so she can provide this information.

I am reaching out to some listed in ALM for this aged OPW.  I have a task to conduct a security assessment on the Philips Pegasus system, but I do not have the information I need – namely, a current MDS2 form.
Does anyone have a contact at Philips (or the reseller) for this device that you can share?  I’m trying to get ahold of someone that can supply an updated MDS2.
Thanks in advance,""

Please let us know how should we move forward with PillCam
Background:
My understanding is that the device will be connected to a local PC using a cradle (USB?) .
but we are not sure if there a need to install software to PC or it is already installed since the device is a replacement. On this point,  Emma A assumed that there is a software to be installed on DH workstation and will communicate with Medtronic SaaS solution. Therefore, Emma A requested clarifications from Robert Tate at Medtronic on 4/30 and I followed up on 5/10 without a response.

Emma A assumes there is a software to be installed on DH workstation and will communicate with Medtronic SaaS solution
Emma A requested clarifications from Robert Tate at Medtronics on 4/30 and GT followed up on 5/10
GT 4/30
The device will be conntected to workstation to download the recorded images.
1- I assume the device will connect to the workstation via special USB cradle. correct?
2- will we implement a new workstation?
3- it does not seem that the system will communicate with any system. correct?
please advise

HI Neil-
I have read the intake – missing a few bits of info.  But I have also looked at the MDS2- and I have questions.
<>
Does this software/pc need interfaces setup to communicate with Cerner? No
<>
I assume some sort of Medtronic camera needs to communicate with the PC – yes/no?  Is the camera already in use? It’s my understanding we Pillcams in production.  This is for a new version.
<>
<>
Can you describe the data workflow associated with this use?
<>
I do not know the data workflow.  Robert Tate with Medtronic should be able to provide this.  I’ve CC’d him on this message.
Thanks – I can’t accept it into MDICI without these clarifications.

Anderson, Emma - PHX , 6/5/2019 8:44:29 AM:  from Brian Smith: Hi Brett,
Here you go. My apologies for the delayed response, I had to reach out to Philips for assistance.
Will the device be integrated to authenticate using users’ AD credentials? – It is currently not setup to require credentials to login. Here are the 3 levels of access controls. Access Controls- 3 levels- No restrictions- anyone can get it- Pt Data Lock- use the system but no access to completed exams- Complete Lock Down- can’t use system without a password.
If not, will users have individual user accounts or will credentials be shared (or turned off completely)? This has not been decided but I will get with the ED physicians to discuss. However – is there a requirement?
The intake form states that data will be manually purged periodically. How often is that? This will likely be done once a month.

Will the device be integrated to authenticate using users’ AD credentials?
No.
If not, will users have individual user accounts or will credentials be shared (or turned off completely)?
Turned off completely.

I am sorry I was not clear,
It is a Clinitek Status Plus with a connector, so Clinitek Status Connect.
We have three identical devices already in use in the ED.
Thanks
Dora
Is this devices the Clinitek Connect or just the Clinitek Status?  Today St. Mary’s is licensed for the Clinitek Connect (Bi-Directional) device. If you are looking to connect the Clinitek Status Plus (Base model – Unidirectional) then I will need to know how many devices you are looking to connect. We will need to order Lantronix devices in order to connect the base mode Clinitek Status Plus in order to connect to the network.  I will also need to check to see if there will be any TELCOR license costs as we will need to install a separate driver to connect the unidirectional Clinitek Status Plus.

the Technical design piece of this implementation is complete.  the IP that has been assigned for the DaVinci is 10.185.85.214
I believe you may still need to submit the On Site Survey to Intuitive Surgical before they can complete their portion.  I am attaching the documents on this effort - the one with TD within the title should have the information you need to complete the survey.

If that part is not successful then the ED department will have to purchase their own digate/workstation so that these exams will flow properly to the LTA.

the attached MDS2 (new) and previous security review (ALM18) needs to be re-worked/reviewed.  the device went live back in January.  the vendor provided an updated device and we just received the updated MDS2.  Mike took a quick look and did not see many differences between the two MDS2 forms but we need someone from your team to re-review.  Dave Arnold was the original security engineer.
Please let me know who will perform the re-review so I can update ALM and Planview.

Subject: RE: i-STAT MAC Addresses
Hello,
The last I remember from this project was that we were trying to figure out what DE server was going to be used?
Is 10.181.205.26 the IP of the DE server?
___________________________________________________________
Barrett, Tanya - PHX , 8/19/2019 11:05:30 AM:  Baij is working w/ RALS.  DE is pending.  Assigning ticket to Kyle.
___________________________________________________________

___________________________________________________________
Barrett, Tanya - PHX , 6/10/2019 11:09:34 AM:  Yes - DE server is the standard for iStat and iStat also goes through RALS.  Dhaval will look at intake to determine if this is additional device with same orders or if there are changes needed.
___________________________________________________________
Anderson, Emma - PHX , 6/3/2019 10:16:27 AM:  does RALS need to interface with the DE server?  is it the same DE server/s that Telcor interfaces with?
___________________________________________________________

Anderson, Emma - PHX , 3/28/2019 2:36:38 PM:   Email responses from Moses regarding security: Questions:
If PHI will be present on the device,  will it be removed after each procedure     or at the end of the work shift?
Yes
From Intake: Do we have any proof of this? I believe the PHI will the account number (FIN) of the patient to be scanned/inputted. After that, we can either choose to delete daily or weekly but there is a way in the operator manual to recall or delete stored patient or QC results.
1-1 Can the device be configured to     force reauthorization of logged-in     user(s) after a predetermined length of     inactivity (e.g., auto-logoff, session lock,     password protected screen saver)?
Yes
Preferred answer.
No
Exception Required. Unless section 1 of screening questions is ""true"".
Note
Screens timeout to main Ready screen; configurable Authorized Operator feature     to force user to re-enter an ID to conduct a test
Can we confirm that the Authorized Operator feature  will be configured to force ID Each operator will have an unique code to represent their sign on. I intend to turn on this feature just like all my other devices I have interfaced. Operator manual said: this analyzer does store up to 700 operators.
<>
From Design document, can you confirm this is the case? This don’t know.
12-1.1 Does the device support unique     user/operator-specific IDs and     passwords for multiple users?
Yes
Preferred answer.
No
Exception Required. Unless section 1 of screening questions is ""true"".
Note
Administrator can configure an Authorized Operator list containing user IDs only
Can we confirm that each user will have their own ID uploaded to the device? Each user will have own user ID.
18-3 Is private data transmission     restricted to a fixed list of network     destinations?
Yes
Preferred answer. Assessor should review firewall rule if device communicates     outside of semi-trusted network.
No
Exception required if firewall is excessively permissive. No ""any"" rules.
Note
Clinitek Status® Connect platform must be configured to enable Ethernet or Wi-Fi     connectivity with a specific IP or LIS host name and port number in order to transfer     data.  System cannot be remotely interrogated from any IP address.
Do we actually have the firewall rules for this device to restrict its communication only to the ports listed in the design diagram? I have attached Connect LIS specification the company sent me. Their security options are: WEP, WPA, WPA PSK. I have also attached the operator manual for more information.

___________________________________________________________ READ THIS:
Team
I have been working with various teams to replace the XP Digate that serves Philips Room 3 with a standard pc.
The XP device is using a Dual NIC Configuration to handle the communication between 10.37.94.xxx (Segmented Non Routable VLAN) and 10.37.90.xxx current 4th Floor Radiology VLAN.
This is not a supported configuration going forward, and because 10.37.94.xxx is segmented non routable we are not able to add firewall rules to allow communication with the “outside” world.
Is also not a network configuration that exists anywhere else other than at St Joes.
The only option for the work is to Reconfigure the Modality to be on the Semitrusted VLAN as it is the standard for Dignity Health.
I have been working with NS Data, Firewall, and EUS to get this work done, unfortunately I do not have a way to get an IP on the Semitrusted VLAN.
The most expeditious way to do this is to take the Philips room through the MDICI process so we can get an IP Address on the SEMITRUSTED VLAN from the Build Team.
The Attached form needs to be completed and submitted to Emma so she can initiate that process.
Nick I filled out the form as best as I could but there are some fields that are still missing information please be sure to review and add the missing information.
When the IP Address is secured for the Modality a firewall request will be added to allow the communication between Modality and Digate.
We will need to provide this information to the NS Data team to reconfigure the Switch Ports.

I just met with Rel and he informed me that the Siemens Somaton listed in the intake request is the existing modality which is currently connected to the network and interacting with the catapult. The request was submitted for the future replacement. However, at this time it is unknown when the new modality will be purchased or what model this will be.
How would you like to proceed? Should we close this effort and have the facility submit a new request once they have the new device?
Thanks,
Paul Franco Soriano, MIS

Anderson, Emma - PHX , 1/2/2019 7:43:06 AM:  Hi Rel and Elias,
Can you please confirm that the IP address below is the correct IP for the catapult that will be used? I have it listed as US Catapult/DRS-655-504. Please advise.
10.92.200.86
___________________________________________________________ from Tomas:
Paul, Emma,
Here is the design for the Siemens Somatom Edge. It is posted below in SharePoint.
I am skeptical of the intake form as it said there was no other device that this modality connects to other than the PACS system, however the PACS is a Merge Unity system, which uses a Digate computer for all images to PACS. There was not a workstation listed, and no additional ports or IP’s to do a design with, but let me know if there is a Digate, and what the parameters are so I can add it.

Anderson, Emma - PHX , 1/14/2019 11:15:00 AM:  Dusty recommends serial connection of the M50 to Epicenter.  Depends on the BD vendor's connection to epicenter. Emma to check with site regarding vendor onsite timing. DE should follow the vendor setup.
___________________________________________________________
Anderson, Emma - PHX , 1/7/2019 2:49:15 PM:  per Dusty:
I have the answer to my questions:
The AP (Specimen processing) connects to the M50 (sensitivity and ID) which connects to the Epicenter (organism ID).
So the AP connects to the M50, which in turn, is the only one connected to the Epi.
___________________________________________________________
Anderson, Emma - PHX , 12/12/2018 2:21:45 PM:   Nemmir is checking to see if Epicenter already is deployed at CHMC.  This is middleware.  northridge does have this MDI setup.

California Hospital Medical Center needs to implement the Cadwell ARC Essentia plus Cadlink server (EEG; workstation; server/data storage; remote access) in order to be in compliance with the handling of ePHI.  In addition, this is a Joint Commission Survey year for CHMC.
George Takla and I met with Anthony, Psalms, and Deborah - along with representatives from Cadwell.  George has mocked up a solution design (will forward it when available).  It confirmed that this falls outside the MDICI framework and needs to be created as an IT project.  CHMC is purchasing Dignity Health hardware (workstations, server (?)) for the Cadwell software programs to reside.  They will also need the Cadwell client application available on Citrix for remote reading.
Please add this to your intake/discovery process.
thank you - Emma

California Hospital Medical Center submitted this request to the MDICI program.  Unfortunately, due to complexity and server requirements, it must be submitted as a IT project.  According to Brenna Yaekle, the EEG system falls under Cardiology service line - so I am forwarding to you all the information that we have collected on CHMC's behalf in order to hopefully expedite the process.
Deborah Jackson is the site IT Program Manager - please contact her if you have any questions.

___________________________________________________________ I received the MDS2 from the vendor this morning.
To clarify, the Bayer Injector itself will not be on the network.
There is a small communications box that sits on our network and the Bayer Injector can be plugged into it for remote diagnostics by Bayer.
It might be a little confusing based on the name I gave the MDICI sheet. It’s really the Solaris Communications Box that is the focus of network connectivity and it’s part of the Bayer Injector package.
Thanks,
Sam

Hi Emma –
North State request for the Bayer injector that will be separate, but related to the MMCMS MRI project we are finishing at Mt Shasta. This device will sit on our network for Bayer remote diagnostic purposes only. Vendor is sending me the MDS2, but did provide the tech sheet for the remote portion of the device (VirtualCare Whitepaper PDF). Device is on-site and MAC has been provided.

Harper, Robert - PHX , 9/16/2019 7:24:29 AM:  Reached out to Kevin Williams to set up meeting to go over any missing information on this request.
___________________________________________________________
Harper, Robert - PHX , 9/13/2019 11:56:44 AM:         Last update to Tomas, from Kevin Williams.  Still unable to see Solution documentation.   Reached out to Tomas to see if he needed further information Sept 6th, no reply received. Unable to provide any further update to project.   I spoke with Robert Harper on this one, and can validated a few more things. Dennis, Tomas… you may need to still revisit a few things.
Telcor and Rals are two different middleware servers so that needs to be hashed out. (This one is Telcor validated… if the ip really is 10.248.16.55 ) This is Telcor real Ip 10.248.16.55
The Avox meter can connect a few different ways. You need to first determine if these are solicited or unsolicited order request. These are Unsolicited results, so this will match the design exactly me and Tomas did at CHMC.
The Vendor box needs to be fully identified. Specs, OS, etc….. historically we connect these through lantronix, if it is going to a vendor PC for terminal services… Why? This is not a Vendor box, This is a lantronix box m# uds2100.
Lastly, the intake form, and MDS2 form should have had this, if this wasn’t clear, I assume Tomas may need to re-engage the lab team to resubmit those. This should still be updated if not documented accordingly.

I believe you all have hours in PlanView on this project.  During our Telcor meeting today they flagged this project as “stalled” awaiting connectivity.  It looks like the Solution Arch, Design, and Security documents are attached in the ticket so I believe we are just waiting on network/firewall in order to connect.  Since we have Telcor resources actively engaged this is now a high priority ticket.  Please let me know if you need something additional to proceed.  Thanks

___________________________________________________________
Anderson, Emma - PHX , 1/10/2019 9:36:45 AM:  device has been received .  Per Carrie's email"" Hi Carrie-
Thanks for the quick update on the monthly lab call.  I have a few more questions/activities that hopefully you will be able to answer for us.
PO for Telcor will need to be created in order to put this in the Telcor queue. - I have not done this - Is there a specific cost that needs to be stated?
Does this purchase include a Hemochron?  (My Solution Architect is used to this being a paired implementation – just need confirmation) - No -
The intake document mentions serial connection to a workstation – is this a new workstation? Is it a PC style workstation? Or a lab box that dangles from the device? We will connect it to an existing PC style workstation for download when not in use in one of the cath lab room.
You mentioned that the Avox is on backorder- do you have an anticipated date for delivery?  Avoximeter was delivered today and is sitting in my office.
___________________________________________________________
Anderson, Emma - PHX , 12/21/2018 1:28:21 PM:  will they be adding or replacing a hemochron too?
per email from Tomas:
Emma, Paul,
The SA design is completed and posted in SharePoint,  but there are some questions on this one.
The intake references a workstation that the instrument connects to via a serial connection. It is shown on my design. I’ve done one other one of these (posted in a sub-folder a level up from this minor effort in SP), and that one didn’t have a workstation referenced.
I need to know if the workstation is a vendor workstation, and if it is part of the new instrument being installed. There was no contact on the intake other than the support phone number. If you have a contact, please send it my way or let me know if you know what the workstation parameters are (OS Type, vendor supported, needs backup, needs AV, etc.).
Also, I’ve left the existing Hemochron on this design that was part of the other Avox I did, so I will need to know if that is not a part of this minor effort.

Attached is the solution for the project.
I posted in WIP/Siemens/Acuson (plz note the request details and MDS2 states vendor as Siemens but proj name includes Philips )
in prior Acuson, we had to use M2M wireless device. I asked if this is the case for SRDH but did not get an answer.
Thanks

Hey Greg-
See MAC address below for your new system. I also wanted to let you know that a printer will arrive with the C-Arm. A prepaid return shipping label will be included, when the system arrives can you set aside the printer for fedex pick up? As you know, I swapped your order with another customer. I didn’t want any further delays due to a printer so I had corporate release the order. Thanks for your help and understanding. I’ll be in touch later this week regarding a confirmed delivery date. Thanks Greg,

My last notes on this one is that you are ready with the design except you need target IP and port (switchport).  Is this something Dusty can get? or is it an onsite resource that provides it?  Also, Ash Zion has been assigned as the Citrix resource.

Close, but the 10.137.199.0/24 network doesn’t exist – the modalities will need to go on:
Owner:Arch Type:EHR Site:CSB Vlan:199 Semi -Trusted Vendor PACS
Which is on the 10.164.199.0/24 network.
The ip’s and vlans between the legacy and ‘new’ networks are just similar enough to make this confusing (at least to me), and there (evidently) being two facilities (CSB and SMB) under the CHSB umbrella didn’t help.

I spoke with Elizabeth Steckline and this does not need to wait for MDICI in order for you to move forward. Since a new medical device is not being installed - just software update, and wireless adapter - she suggests that you submit a Service Matters ticket to your EUS to make the necessary updates to the device and secure a wireless IP for the adapter.

As far as the facility I only know the following
Hospital Location: 7500 Hospital Ave, Sacramento, CA 95823
Device: Carestream Inc DRX Evolution Plus
Device Location: It is replacing an end of life X-Ray device in the ER X-Ray room
Radiology Department
My contact: Garry Tellez
VLAN 199
Assumed information
I believe it will be connected to switch AS2-114-MAIN-MH as that is what the original device was connected to.
Information I need
Confirmation that the switch mentioned above is the proper switchIf it is not, then I need to know what switch the new device will be using
The switch port that this device will be using
Confirmation that VLAN 199 is trunked to the selected switch
Thank you. Let me know if you or the engineer has any questions

This is the email that I sent Josh on Monday and what I spoke with you about on Tuesday.
I have confirmed that this device only needs 1 IP and switch port, but I still need to know the name of the switch. I believe it is as2-114-main-mh, but I need confirmation of that and what switch port the new device will plug into.

Hello Sir,
I probably misunderstood when you are asking for the IP addresses of the Xeleris workstations. The IP addresses and MAC addresses I provided in this email are existing IP addresses and MAC addresses.  The Xeleris workstations will also be replaced so I do not have the IP addresses  as well as the MAC addresses and they also be needed to be in VLAN199.  The vendor will also need to have a VPN connectivity to the device for remote troubleshooting.  Everything will be provided as soon as the equipment is ready for delivery.
Tentative install date will be last week of January.
Again,  I apologize for the confusion.
Thanks,
Garry Tellez

Just an FYI - MGH will be purchasing a different model (Optima 850).  I have told Garry that I am canceling this line (even though you have all completed your work) - and he will need to resubmit the intake paperwork (and MDS2) for the newer model once they have purchased it.  Hopefully, we will be able to leverage the information that you have already done - but I will not keep this line open.
Please complete out any time you have on this effort -this week.  I will close it on Monday after time approvals.

This effort was larger than originally expected. The first firewall and VPN configurations have already been completed for the Innova device (CTASK0037802). There is also another device called AW workstation which needs to have the following configurations:
Firewall rules
NAT IP for GE vendor support
B2B/VPN configurations
I created request REQ0318181 for fw rules and attached the design and the excel doc in this email. The second tab in this excel document contains the VPN information for firewall configurations. I am adding both of you since you both helped me with the initial request and I don’t know who will continue to manage this.
Is one servicematters ticket enough for fw rules and the VPN? Or should I create another one just for the NAT and VPN configurations?
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,

I have completed the following DE deliverables for this effort:
Technical design – uploaded to SharePoint
IP addresses were not requested as it was decided NOT to connect the workstations on the network. Vendor will have a VPN option in 2019 that could potentially be implemented in future implementations. Webex is not an ideal method for vendor remote support.
FW rules have already been completed in a previous implementation and was validated by Andrew Swangler

Good afternoon-
As we prepare to kickoff your MDI request for the Stago Experts – my solution architect has the following questions:
Initial assessment
1- the prior project indicates using Connectivity Type2 where workstation connects to DEC RS232.
2- the request indicated type 4 where workstation connects to ethernet network.
we need clarification on the connectivity method (type)
Thanks
Can you please let us know the connectivity methodology that will be used at your location?
Thank you!

Anderson, Emma - PHX , 3/6/2019 8:14:04 AM:  Discussion with Mark L: I need help getting that moving.  No one wants the unvalidated studies in PACS.  They are images but not of the same type as PACS images that have a valid order in RIS that can be matched in PACS.  Also, all other PACS images are cared for by rad staff as to validating and making sure no QA issues.  Images from Sonosite become quick dump, many unidenified that cannot be deleted, and end up sitting in and taking up cache space since only validated studies are in PACS.  The SonoSites at other facilities are sent to MMF when the physician (non radiologists) can look at them in Cerner and dictate into their dictation system which is different than PowerScribe.

Subject: Questions for Sonosite M-Turbo
Sorry this is coming so late. I have a few questions on the Sonosite M-Turbo device. Could you please let me know who could answer these for me?
Sonosite M-Turbo Questions:
Will the device be configured to de-identify private data? (MDS2 states it has this capability)
If not, how long will data be stored on the device?
Will the device be configured with individual user accounts (vs sharing accounts)?
How will security updates be provided and applied? MDS2 indicates that “FUJIFILM SonoSite will provide system updates to deploy any applicable security patches” but also states that patches can’t be applied remotely.
According to the MDS2, this device uses VxWorks embedded OS (VxWorks 5.4.2) and a sub-set of Windows CE (WinCE 6.0 R2) for underlying communications tasks”. I found that WinCE 6.0 is no longer supported. I could not find anything on VxWorks. Do you know if this is still supported and can be patched? Is that included in the FujiFilm security patches?
There are a number of identified security concerns with this device, but if the data is de-identified and/or not retained on the device then some of the issues do not need to be documented as exceptions.
Thanks!

Here is the MDICI info collected so far on the MSJ Sonsoite M-Turbos for Radiology.  I believe these are two Ultrasound devices (but I could be mistaken.)  the IT portion was completed - althought Vlan re-configuration at two ports was needed.  We don't know if Ebaad saw that through to completion or not.

Anderson, Emma - PHX , 1/9/2019 11:57:02 AM:  Hello Ronald,
Devices will receive/send O&R to/from Cerner VIA TELCOR.
In regards to the IP address, I am not really sure, but my accu-cheks are connected to this: 10.248.16.40. I am not sure if they are supposed to be the same, but my accu-cheks also go to Telcor.
To be honest, I am not sure where to get all this information, but Amanda from Telcor will probably know the brand for the Lantronix as they should be shipping one out. I included her into this string of email.
Thank you.

Anderson, Emma - PHX , 1/2/2019 7:50:22 AM:  per Amanda: Hello,
The SigELite is network ready and connects to QML directly.  The Avox 1000E connects to QML with a Lantronix UDS 2100.  We provide the Lantronix.  It has not been shipped out yet because there is a limited warrantee on it (30 days) during which it can be returned.  If you need it sent now, I can do that so you can get the MAC address off it.  The Lantronix needs to have a static IP address.   The port information is listed in the device tips which I have attached.  There are different ports for each device type.
Validation will be done in QML test first.  The device will then be connected to production.  I have both the server names and IP’s listed below.  Because I am sending this information, I have made the email string secure.  These are existing applications.  No servers are needed. The devices will connect to QML, and QML will send the results out via the existing results interface to Cerner. I didn’t receive the design document so I can’t comment on what it showed.
QML Test IP: 10.248.16.54
Test Server name: PHX-VAIO-011
QML Production IP: 10.248.16.55
Prod Server name: PHX-VINT-031

Per our conversation you were considering this defect complete as implementing the Coronary Tools workstation was out of scope. I made note of that in my design, but I did include the portion of the implementation incase someone else comes back and want to implement it. This will give them a starting point.
Here is the updated link to the completed design -> https://projects.dignityhealth.org/projects/pdl/Designs/Philips/Azurion%207/20181010%20-%20Imaging%20%20ID130%20NHMC%20Philips%20Azurion/1003688%20-%20TD%20-%20ID130%20NHMC%20Philips%20Azurion.pdf

Lenczewski, Michael - PHX , 4/4/2019 8:22:50 AM:  Responses from vendor to Jordan:
What device(s) does this new workstation need to communicate with?  The Azurion Suite PC / Azurion System = Hospital Network    MAC Address = 28:B9:D9:E0:02:5C    10.149.199.21 will send to Cardiology pacs at 10.149.205.43 port 1111 and Radiology pacs at 10.149.200.22 port 2104.   It will also need to receive from Azzurion at 10.149.199.21 port 104Does this go inbetween the modality and PACS or is this workstation just another route to PACS?  The Azurion can send to this device or directly to Cardiology PACS I believe the (Workstation = Coronary Tools PC) will be a bidirectional communication with the Azurion Suite PC and as well it is capable of sending to PACs separately from the Suite PC.
Does this workstation need to talk to both PACS system in the setup or just one?   Will send to Cardiology pacs and Radiology
What VLAN does this new workstation need to be on? Same as the modality?    Yes,  same vlan fine
What ports need to be opened on the firewall for this to work?   TBA  Rodney’s team getting drops ready.
Does this workstation need to be accessible over the Philips VPN?   Yes, same as Azurion

I found the BAA that Dignity Health and all covered entities have for St. Jude/ Abbott.  We can move forward with the use of the equipment.  I ask that you please let me know the start and stop dates of the studies performed and that you will ensure all PHI is purged prior to sending the equipment back if we do not purchase it.  If we do purchase the equipment and it will be placed on our network then a Privacy Impact Assessment will need to be completed and Cyndi Lang can assist with that process.

I just noticed this e-mail you sent had some questions for me.  Sorry!  This will be wireless only because the wired port will have an Airborne wireless unit plugged into it so it can have wireless access.  We do this for all our Philips devices because the built in wireless is inherently spotty.  Therefore there is no wired port available to be used.  The port is correct (12018).  We have dozens of ports setup in our PACS which are tied to data morphers which change the inbound traffic.  12018 flags the data as “OTHER” because the ED is using this device and not our ultrasound techs (whose exams normally get flagged as RAD).  We exclude “OTHER” exams from showing up in normal places in PACS.  Thanks,

Anderson, Emma - PHX , 10/4/2018 11:56:41 AM:  Answers from Jill Elia (forwarded to Dave Arnold): Good morning Jill-
I am reaching out to you directly since Jeff is on PTO.  As we prepare to deploy the Natus Retinal Camera for you – I need to understand a few items:
1.        The intake form says that it is a stand-along device – so this does not need to connect to the Dignity Health Network at all? It does not now connect to our network. I believe we are working on a process of eventually plugging it into an existing port that Family Birth Center uses for their OB only ultrasound machine. Jeff will have to speak to this process, way out of my area of expertise.
2.       Does Natus need remote access to/from this device for any reason? Not that I am aware of or that was ever discussed during training
3.       If PHI is manually entered into the device for the ocular scan – does the PHI automatically delete from the device once the scan is complete/printed? The nurse performing the scan manually enters whatever identifiers used .Scans are not ever printed. PHI remains on the machine until deleted, it does not automatically delete.
4.       How is the patient record updated with the results of the scan? Currently, we are planning to transfer the images to a secure password protected USB drive and then upload them to a shared drive. From there, we will notify a person in IT who is going to grab them and pull them into our PACS system, which the MD will be able to log in via Infuse and then view.

Closed - Will the facility abide by an SOP that calls for deletion of all stored data at the end of a test/procedure or shift? No. Data will be present for at least several weeks. Screening test fails. Full assessment required.
Closed - 12-2 Can the device be configured to authenticate users through an external authentication service (e.g., MS Active Directory, NDS, LDAP, etc.)?
The MDS2 answers “yes” to the question above. Can the facility confirm that this device will be configured to integrate to A/D? While the device can be configured to leverage A/D for authentication, this will not be done. Therefore, this will be added to the exception. An SOP that outlines provisioning and password policy must be documented.
Open - The intake form indicates that there is a firewall that segments the semi-trusted network at the facility. Can I please have the IP’s and ports that the device will need opened on that firewall in order to function? Trying to get my hands on the firewall rule. In talking to Greg, it sounds like there is a range of source IP’s preconfigured to connect to PAC’s, as there is never a need to request a firewall rule for a system that is wired.
Open - The MDS2 indicates that it uses Win 7 operating system. Can the facility confirm that extended support for Win 7 is in place for whomever is managing these devices? Still trying to get the answer to this question. Greg provided some contacts that might be able to help.

2- Does the MDS2 covers the detection device of the laptop (it seems to be covering the laptop)?
3- if we get vendro laptop, will it be connected to Dignity Health network? if yes, for what purpose?

Can you please contact the local EUS resource to ensure that this device was configured/installed appropriately? This will need to be tested asap.
I confirmed that the existing IP addresses for the RAP box and the Lantronix server are the only ones we need for this implementation. The workstation will be connected to the Lantronix server and RAP box via serial connection and will not require an IP address.
I confirmed that the firewall rules are already in place for the Lantronix server and RAP box.

When you verify the MAC address, can you please let me know if the device looks like the picture below? If it doesn’t look like this one, can you please send me a picture of the device? In addition, if the device came with a configuration/installation manual, can you please find out if the device can support “Proxy User Authentication”? I have been trying to get a hold of the vendor but no response yet. Please let me know if you would like to have a phone conversation so that I can clarify what I am looking for.
<>
Hi Daniel,
Once the MAC address has been verified, I can go ahead and make the DHCP reservation for the wireless IP address.
Hi Emma,
Starting today, all DEs will be responsible for obtaining the wireless IP address. Any DHCP reservations made by the facility before Today can continue with the same old process. The Intake Request will need to be updated with the removal of the statement below:
“If wireless you will need to request a service account. Wireless IP should be provided by local IT/ EUS.  Project team will need the wireless IP to submit firewall rules. All wireless devices should be placed on ent_Stnet.”
Thanks,
Paul Franco Soriano, MIS
Design Engineer

Anderson, Emma - PHX , 10/16/2018 8:26:24 AM:  from Paul Soriano: Hi,
I am just following up on these questions, and added one more.
What VLAN is this device going to be connected to? Intake doc states “possibly VLAN 209”. Has this been confirmed? This will be ent_stnet vlan 904.
The vendor’s documentation indicates that for “Wi-Fi connectivity this device will require the use of a compactible USB Wi-Fi adapter”. Has this been procured?
What is the device’s wireless MAC address?
What is the wireless IP address?
Regarding the workstation(s) that will access the web portal, are they in the trusted or semi-trusted environment?
Please provide feedback on these questions so that I can finish the tech design portion.

Rapisarda, Jaclyn - PHX , 8/13/2019 2:22:15 PM:  Per Pete - The Hologic unit is one of the modalities that will be installed as part of that imaging bundle. The Hologic will be the first modality that will be installed of the imaging bundle, the other modalities that are included in the bundle are two x-ray rooms, one MRI unit, and one CT unit. We should have a roadmap in the next week or two with timelines of construction start, construction complete, and equipment installation time frames.  On a side note, 250K of the funds for the Hologic were provided by the community who is eager to see the Hologic installed, as we are. We can provide estimated roadmap when we receive it from construction.

Anderson, Emma - PHX , 4/23/2019 2:20:56 PM:  checked in with Pete.  Hologic will be occurring much sooner, we are finalizing contract with the architect Firm and Dignity Health. I suspect we will have a kickoff for this within the next 3 weeks and Holigic will be the first modality that we will install.  Not sure how long the room construction will take, but it is minor.
I will leave this effort on the portfolio- should install before end of Fiscal.

Anderson, Emma - PHX , 10/1/2018 2:08:09 PM:  (from Garry to Preet) Hi ,
As per below , we have 2 links to MOB, first one is Layer3 and the second is Layer 2. (Not sure if there was any reason, for 2 diff links).
I am working on the design collapse the layer3 boundary between WHC and the MOB.
For this Pacs project , as the device needs to be plugged into vlan 199, if the device  can be connected to as3-m711-mob-whc or as4-m711-mob-whc, then vlan 199 can be extended to the site.
I will keep you posted with the process of my design.
Thanks

Subject: RE: Mortara 280/380 assessments
The MDS2 I reviewed was done by Jisun Yoo in Sept 2017 for the 380. This answer set mirrors the 280 MDS2 dated June 2014 done by Barry Brown.
AD/LDAP is No, which triggers section 2/audit trails as No – NA (no unique users, one shared account). And Yes for drive encryption.
These answers differ from an older Mortara 380 MDS2 (sw v1.2) marked PRELIMINARY – which does support LDAP/audit trails, but no drive encryption.
Thanks,

Andrei,
I looked at the Cybersecurity review for the iSed. The items that were listed do not apply to the way plan to set up and use the instrument; no PHI will ever be entered or stored into the analyzer. The instrument does not download any patient information, the LIS connection is one directional (results coming from the analyzer to the LIS ).
I have confirmed this with Matthew McIntire at Alcor (contact info below). Matthew is our contact for any concerns or questions the Dignity Cybersecurity team, or anyone else, may have.
Thank You,
Jason Lampel CLS/MLS(ASCP)

Lenczewski, Michael - PHX , 2/6/2020 10:29:47 AM:  Per Joel S: We are still unable to connect from the Iron Mountain “Daemon Server” to the Respirator Gating system. We can connect to it… and see patient lists, but when we try to retrieve data from the Daemon server the connection breaks.
We currently have our True Beam system that is working (10.106.199.25) and its firewall rules were compared to the new rules we put in for the Respiratory Gating system. They look similar, albeit with different IP Addresses and ports, but the direction/flow of traffic look the same.
To test a bit more we installed the Telnet service on the Daemon server and tried to connect manually to the Respiratory Gating system on port 51600, but this failed. We then placed a non-domain (Dignity Health Owned) Windows machine on the PACS Semi-trusted network (VLAN 199) to simulate the Respiratory Gating System (I.E. we gave it the same 10.106.199.30 IP and turned off the firewall) and we were still not able to connect via telnet to the allowed port 51600.

Anderson, Emma - PHX , 12/21/2018 8:55:10 AM:  Ron sent email to Helen - pending clarification of answers - the design is complete. Awaiting feedback from Helen at Varian, but we may get lucky and this one only requires a firewall rule from the ARIA firewall to the Varian SmartConnect.  I’m pretty certain no ip addresses will be required, as the camera looks to connect to the private ARIA network at SEQ; also I don’t see anything in the quote that indicates additional workstations.  Assuming DH doesn’t use SmartConnect currently, I added a firewall rule outbound from the ARIA firewall to SmartConnect.
email sent to Helen:
Helen,
I’m wrapping up the design for the RGSC, and I’ve a few questions.
Am I correct in assuming the camera will be connected to the private network behind the Varian firewall, on the 172.20.20.0/24 network?
If so, after the camera is connected to either a Varian network switch or the ARIA firewall, will Varian handle the network configuration of the camera?
Are there any additional workstations to be installed (also behind the ARIA firewall) that will run the RPM software, or will additional client software be installed on the existing workstation(s)?
Will the workstation(s) be writing data to the database that resides on the Varian Cloud at the Iron Medical Systems Cloud?
Will the workstation(s) be interacting at all with a DH PACS server, or does that interaction occur through an already-existing connection from the DH PACS to the Varian Cloud?
Finally, it appears that SmartConnect will be used for remote monitoring of the RGSC, with connections initiated by the camera.  Is SmartConnect already operational for the SEQ site, or do I need to have a firewall rule written from the SEQ ARIA firewall (10.106.199.20) to the SmartConnect portal at 132.190.92.210?

___________________________________________________________ Currently, I indicated that remote access for support is not provided by the vendor per Dean Weeks (ILW rep). Dean wanted to confirm with company’s engineers. Meanwhile, I am going with the assumption that remote support is not available which does not fulfill the request by site and your suggestion to use Backman RAP device.
Thanks
George

I requested that Nancy re-assign this effort to you.  You are working on a similar one for Dominican - but this Merced effort is from APRIL.  Kevin has done a fair amount of work on this effort but we seem stalled.  Please get his design files from him and get IPs assigned to these 6 Clinitek POC units.  MAC addresses are further down in the comments.

___________________________________________________________
Lenczewski, Michael - PHX , 1/4/2019 9:54:18 AM:  Per the Vendor: PADnet is agnostic to the controlling device, all we need is a web browser to operate. Think of the iPad/laptop as getting a new cart, it’s not necessary to the operation of the device, and it won’t change the MDS2.
You are more than welcome to do what you wish to the HP 2 in 1, including installing anti-virus and encryption, and note that no PHI is stored on the device, everything is stored on the PADnet and eliminated from local storage on the PADnet once it syncs with the cloud-based service.
The only issue you may run into, is if your security setup locks down the Chrome browser, that’s a very rare issue I’ve seen occur though. If you want to discuss further, feel free to call my cell phone.

Anderson, Emma - PHX , 10/2/2018 9:19:00 AM: Subsequent note from Lloyd:Unfortunately it requires the CHW domain credentials every time it needs to be mapped which can cause other account issues when passwords change and security issues. Right now the computer is logged in with the Local account that was provided by the vendor. So if it is mapped using employee A network credentials Employee B,C, D will have access as employee A and not them self which is a big security concern. ___________________________________________________________

Unable to access the shared folder via the name. It requires CHW credentials so I cannot map it for everyone. But I have verified it will map to the drive. The device is unable to access the Domain controller so I am unable to add it to the CHW domain (Which is required to map the drive for everyone that logs into the system) Sorry for the delay in getting up to look at this. ___________________________________________________________ Anderson, Emma - PHX , 8/30/2018 1:31:00 PM: 8/21: per DV: In regards to getting the VLAN to the Switch Port, some modifications have been made.

I’ve added Marcus Carnohan to this email thread as the CI for French Hospital. Assuming it is true local and there are no objections on the lab side, this likely can be “bypassed” which allows this to move to resourcing. Marcus, Since this is a project that appears to have dedicated resources, please include that in the request so that resourcing sends it to your dedicated build team rather than CRD.

Preet - Outside of a brand new Firewall the rest of the Network gear at this location is the end of support from Cisco and is over 10 years old. There are 5 Access Switches that are daisy chained together one after the other. Any idea if this location is slated for a refresh any time soon?

Hey Paul
I understand that we will need a firewall in place at Plaza Surgery Center for the attached modality to access the Semi-Trusted network. I have spoken with Joel about this and he provided me with your contact information as a Network Architect which is why I am reaching out to you. I'm also not sure if the attached diagram is accurate as well since I was going off of historical documentation from other projects so any clarification there would be helpful (Kyle, feel free to pick it apart as well).
Here's a quick rundown of who is on this email and their roles in case you are wondering:
Maurizio - Firewall Engineer
Anup - Technical Owner
Kyle - Design Engineer
Anthony - Project Manager
What is required of me, or those in this email, to get this underway? Many thanks for your time!

Anthony Damiano <adamiano001>, 12/26/2023 6:33:35 AM:  A new MDICI project request was put into the system under ALM ID 2044 FHMC Werfen ACP Top 350.
Below is the information put on the intake form for systems this project will need to communicate with:
What system(s) will this device be connected to?                  Cerner, possibly IM or through Lantronix or CCE4 server
Will this connect to a single or multi-port Lantronix Term Server?
Is there a Cerner CCE already installed at FHMC that we can use?
Or will it be going through an instrument manager?
Below is the start of a connectivity diagram. I need more details around this; which connection option will be used to get this device's data to Cerner? Dusty and Dhaval are CC'd on this, hopefully they will be able to help with some of these details. Once I fully understand the connectivity request for the ACL TOP I will assign resources and a start date. From the start date of the project it can take up to four weeks before the device is ready to test. Once this project is ready to test I will send out networking information with the technical design in a separate email.
